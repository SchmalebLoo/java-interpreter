# Java Interpreter

This repository contains the implementation of a simple Java-based interpreter. The interpreter processes input code using a defined Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) framework, a scanner, and tokenization. Created by Schmaleb using many online resources and tutorials.

# Files Overview

> Framework.java: The core framework supporting the interpreter's architecture.

> GenerateAST.java: Generates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) used for parsing and executing code.

> Scanner.java: Handles the lexical analysis of the input, breaking it into tokens.

> Token.java: Defines the structure of a token generated during the scanning process.

> TokenType.java: Enumerates the various types of tokens recognized by the interpreter.
